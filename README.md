# **SeamCarve: Intelligent Image Resizing**  

## **📌 Overview**  
SeamCarve is an advanced **content-aware image resizing** algorithm that intelligently removes or adds seams (low-energy paths) to preserve important details. It utilizes **Numba-optimized dynamic programming** for fast seam removal and real-time visualization.  

## **🚀 Features**  
✔️ **Energy Map Calculation** – Identifies important pixels using gradients  
✔️ **Dynamic Seam Removal** – Finds and removes least important pixels  
✔️ **Parallel Optimization** – Utilizes Numba for performance boost  
✔️ **Vertical & Horizontal Resizing** – Supports both width and height adjustments  
✔️ **Seam Visualization** – Highlights removed seams for better understanding
